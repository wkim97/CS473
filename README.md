Project Galbi Hi-fi Prototype

Our main javascript page is login.html, where users enter their user id and password.

After login, user is directed to friends.html, where the user can 1) type in their meal preferences and 2) check their friends' meal preferences. 

Then, user can move to chats section, or chats.html, where the user can register his/her meal plan and make an open chat room. The user can also check list of meal planning chat rooms available.

Once the user clicks an open chat room and enter it, the chatting platform will open. In that room, users can communicate using keywords and emojis to make a meal arrangement, including cuisine types, restaurants, and time.
